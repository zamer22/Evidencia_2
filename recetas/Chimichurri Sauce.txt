This easy recipe is my version of Argentinian chimichurri, a tangy sauce made with fresh herbs, garlic, olive oil, and vinegar. Drizzle it over roasted veggies, use it as a salad dressing, or toss it with any cooked grain for a vibrant pop of flavor.


Equipment
Mortar and Pestle



Ingredients:
1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons white wine vinegar
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 teaspoon sea salt
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika
1/2 cup finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, (from about 1 bunch of parsley, coarse stems removed)


Instructions
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, garlic, salt, oregano, red pepper flakes, and smoked paprika. Stir in the parsley. Alternatively, you could combine the ingredients in a mortar and pestle or with a few pulses in a food processor.

2. Season to taste and serve as a sauce over roasted or grilled vegetables.
